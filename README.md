# JDoom

JDoom is a pure Java Doom source port.

It is forked from MochaDoom and adds code efficiency, removal of some manual routines with built-in java routines, removes the high resolution rendering, removes all but the multithreaded renderer.
Think of it as the 'Chocolate Doom of Java'.

JDK 15 and above are supported.
